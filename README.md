Raghav and Lavanyas Machine Learning Q2 project - Enhancing Naive Bayes using techniques like auxiliary features and TF-IDF weighting
Abstract - Spam messages have become an increasingly pervasive issue in the digital era, posing risks such as phishing and malware attacks. Effective spam detection is crucial to maintaining secure communication. While Naive Bayes classifiers are widely used in text classification for their simplicity and computational efficiency, they suffer from certain limitations, such as the independence assumption–attributes are independent of each other–which affects their accuracy. Building on the auxiliary feature method proposed in [3], which enhances classification accuracy by introducing auxiliary features to reclassify the text space, and leveraging insights from the comparison study [6], we aim to explore and apply new enhancements to Naive Bayes to improve spam detection accuracy.
Tutorial:
- Ensure that both the train and test data are downloaded and in the same file as the DependencyGraph.py,IntialNaiveBayes.py,SKlearnNaiveBayes.py,Tf-IDF weigthing.py,
   word2vec.py, and ensemble.py files
- For each of the algorithms run the code, and the accuracy, and confusion matrix will be printed
